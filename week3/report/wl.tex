Both of us had an equal contribution to the implementation, since we've done most of the programming together.
We both had equal contributions to the implementation of exercise 1.
On the other hand, Han focused more on the implementation of exercise 2 while Maarten focused more on the implementation of exercise 3.
Overall, this results in an equal contribution, in our opinion.

For the report, we both had equal contibutions to exercise 2.
Han focused more on the report for exercise 1, and Maarten focused more on the report for exercise 3.
