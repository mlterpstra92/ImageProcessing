\exercise{Highboost filtering}
\setcounter{subsection}{0}

Sometimes it is desirable to highlight high-frequency components in an image without eliminating the low-frequency components.
One way to do this is by using a technique called highboost filtering.
This technique works by first blurring the image, then subtracting the blurred image from the original image.
The result of this operation is called the \emph{mask}.
Finally, the highboost filtered image can be retrieved by adding the mask to the original image.

The entire highboost filter operation is nicely summed up in the following formula:
\[ g(x, y) = f(x, y) +  k(f(x, y) - w \star f(x, y)) \text{,} \]
where \(w\) is a smoothing filter, described below, and \(k\) a parameter that governs the magnitude of the filter.

As a result of the highboost filter, edges are sharper, while retaining most information about low-frequency components. 
\subsection{Implementation}
We have implemented the highboost filter in the function \texttt{IPhighboost}.
We have set the blur mask to the same mask as in \cite[Figure 3.32(a)]{gonzalez2002digital} which is also shown in Table~\ref{tbl:mask}.
\begin{table}[!htb]

      1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The Gaussian mask used for blurring}
    \label{tbl:mask}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

The following code implements the highboost filter operation\footnote{This function uses \texttt{IPfilter}, which is the same function as in the previous lab assignment. The source code for this is also included in the archive for this lab assignment.}:
\matlabexternal{IPhighboost.m}
When applying this function to \texttt{dipxetext.tif}, using multiple values for \(k\), the result in Figure~\ref{fig:dipxe} is retrieved.
The last image, with \(k=4.5\) is, in our opinion, the closest approximation to \cite[Figure 3.40(e)]{gonzalez2002digital}.

\subsection{Negative values}
If an image \(f\) contains only positive values it is possible that the output image \(g\) contains negative values.
Consider the image depicted in Table~\ref{tbl:inImage}.
This image evidently contains only positive values.
However, if this image is processed using \texttt{IPhighboost} with \(k \geq 0.13\) the output image \(g\) will contain a negative value as table~\ref{tbl:outImage} illustrates.

A negative value occurs most notably when a pixel with a small value is surrounded by pixels with large values.
Consider a pixel in \(f\) at location \(( x_0, y_0 )\).
The value of that pixel after the highboost filter will be negative if:

\begin{equation} \label{zero_pixel}
  \begin{split}
    g(x_0, y_0) &< 0 \\
    f(x_0, y_0) +  k(f(x_0, y_0) - w \star f(x_0, y_0)) &< 0 \\
    k(f(x_0, y_0) - w \star f(x_0, y_0)) &< -f(x_0, y_0) \\
    k &< \frac{f(x_0, y_0)}{w \star f(x_0, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

That is, the pixel \((x_0, y_0)\) will be zero at the critical value:
\[k_0 = \frac{f(x_0, y_0)}{w \star f(x_0, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}\]

When we compute the critical \(k\) for our example image in Table~\ref{tbl:inImage}, the value \(k_0 = 0.125\) is retrieved.
