Both of us had an equal contribution to the implementation, since we've done all the programming together.
For the report, Maarten focused more on exercises 1 and 3, while Han mostly did exercise 2, and produced most images.
However, Han did some more expansions to both the report and the code.
Of course, both of us have read and redacted the report.

We feel like both of us have contributed the same effort and time to this assignment.
