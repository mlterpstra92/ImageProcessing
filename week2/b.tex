\subsection{Compute Fourier spectrum}
To compute the Fourier spectrum, \textit{MATLAB}'s \texttt{fft2} and \texttt{fftshift} function have been used.
First, the image is transformed to the Fourier domain, using \texttt{fft2}.
Since \texttt{MATLAB} doesn't center the zero-frequency component, but has the zero-frequency component in the corners \cite{fftshift}, \texttt{fftshift} has been used to center the zero-frequency component.
